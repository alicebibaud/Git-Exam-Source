# Part 3
We’ve tried two different approaches to represent Alyssa P. Hacker’s name, but neither is perfect. Let’s merge the best of both into a single representation!

1.	Check out the “main” branch.
2.	Merge the “part2” branch into the “main” branch. Don’t automatically commit the merge.
3.	Create a merge commit with a message that starts with “[Part 3]”.
4.	Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
