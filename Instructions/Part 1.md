# Part 1
We all love RCOS, but sometimes people get our name wrong! Whoever wrote the `rcos()` function in `Code.py` made such a mistake. We’ll fix the mistake by modifying that function so that it returns the string `"Rensselaer Center for Open Source"` instead of `"Rensselaer Center for Open Software"`.

1.	Check out the “main” branch.
2.	Modify `rcos()` so that it returns the string `"Rensselaer Center for Open Source"`.
3.	Commit the change with a message that starts with “[Part 1]”.
4.	Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
