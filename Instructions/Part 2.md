# Part 2
Alyssa P. Hacker wouldn’t be herself without her middle initial, but some computer systems can’t handle the prodigious “P”! We’ll help her out by trying two different approaches to represent her name.

1.	Check out the “main” branch.
2.	Create a new branch named “part2” and check it out.
3.	Modify `alyssa_p()` so that it returns the string `"p. hacker"`.
4.	Commit the change with a message that starts with “[Part 2]”.
5.	Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
6.	Check out the “main” branch.
7.	Rename `alyssa_p()` to `alyssa()`.
8.	Commit the change with a different message that starts with “[Part 2]”.
9.	Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
