# Part 4
Ben Bitdiddle and Willy Wazoo are such close buddies that they sometimes mix up their own names! Let’s play a prank on them.

(Sometimes, we are all Willy Wazoo…)

1.	Check out the “main” branch.
2.	Create a new branch named “part4” and check it out.
3.	Add a new function `ben()` at the end of the file that returns the string `"wazoo"`.
4.	Commit the change with a message that starts with “[Part 4]”.
5.	Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
6.	Check out the “main” branch.
7.	Add a new function `willy()` at the end of the file that returns the string `"bitdiddle"`.
8.	Commit the change with a different message that starts with “[Part 4]”.
9.	Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
