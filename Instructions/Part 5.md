# Part 5
We’ve had our fun, but it’s now time to help Ben and Willy remember their proper names.

1.	Check out the “main” branch.
2.	Merge the “part4” branch into the “main” branch.
3.	Resolve the merge conflict such that the function `ben()` returns the string `"bitdiddle"` and the function `willy()` returns the string `"wazoo"`.
4.	Create a merge commit with a message that starts with “[Part 5]”.
5.	Push the commit to your private GitHub repository.
